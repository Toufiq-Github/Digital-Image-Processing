# Digital Image Processing â€“ Course Codes

This repository contains my implementations, experiments, and assignments for the **Digital Image Processing (DIP)** course.  
The goal is to apply various DIP techniques using Python and OpenCV, covering both the theoretical concepts and their practical applications.
